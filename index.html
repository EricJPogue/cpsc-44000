  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
  <h3>Sprint 1: Getting Started, Software Engineering Methods, Software as a Service, and Tools of the Trade</h3>

  <p><em>Welcome to Software Engineering!</em> By this point in your software development journey
  I'm sure that you are confident in writing moderately complicated software programs. You've
  learned about structured programming techniques like sequence, selection, and repetition. You've
  learned how to break complicated programs down into more manageable pieces by using functions.
  You've even understand Object-Oriented Programming can help you develope more complex
  applications by utilizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. </p>

  <p>That's wonderful, however to create sophisticated modern programs we need to master some
  additional skills that allow us to effectively work across teams to predictably develop, enhance,
  and maintain complex systems that meet real users needs.  These additional Software Engineering
  skills are included in what we call the Software Development Life Cycle and include topics like
  Project Management, Architecture, Requirement, Testing, Support, Maintenance. These are some of
  the topics that we will be exploring as part of the Software Engineering course.</p>

  <p>You have likely noticed that I am using the term “sprint 1” to describe our first set of course
  activities and assignments. Sprints are part of the Scrum development process. The term is used to
  describe a unit of work which will be delivered in a given amount of time. We will be learning
  more about sprints, Scrum, and Agile development in the coming days. For now it is sufficient to
  know that our sprint 1 activities listed below are expected to take approximately 20 hours of
  focused effort to complete.</p>

  <p>Let's start with what we hope to learn in sprint 1. By the end of sprint 1 we will be able to:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>describe the basic steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</li>
    <li>compare and contrast software life cycle methodologies</li>
    <li>explain why agile development has become the preferred software development process</li>
    <li>define software quality</li>
    <li>describe software as a service and its benefits to users and developers</li>
    <li>explain legacy code</li>
    <li>list the pros and cons of cloud computing</li>
    <li>describe client-server, three-tier and MVC design patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Below is our sprint 1 activities list. Although you are welcome to pursue the activities in any order, they are
  listed in the order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. Each item is expected to
  take 20 to 40 minutes of focused time unless otherwise noted. Highlighted activities are
  <em>directly</em> related to graded assignments.</p>

  <h3>Sprint 3: Graphical User Interfaces and FaceDraw</h3>
        <br>

        <p><b><i>Welcome to Sprint 3.</i></b> We have covered a lot in the first two sprints. Much of it was preparing
        us for our first substantial programming assignment. I believe we are ready to apply what we have learned to our
        FaceDraw project. Be sure to get an early start on the project and stay focused. You will note that there are
        fewer items on our activities list this week. That is because you will need to focus your time and energy on
        FaceDraw.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop a moderately sophisticated graphical Java application (FaceDraw)</li>
            <li>Comfortably utilize our Java development environment</li>
            <li>Utilize source code management and Git/GitHub</li>
            <li>Effectively compile, debug, submit, update, and manage Java application source code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you would expect, our activities list for this sprint (below) is laser focused on helping us achieve the
        above Learning Objectives. Once again I have attempted to list this items in the order that I think will be most
        beneficial for you to complete them.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start working on Programming Assignment 3 - FaceDraw and Quiz 3</li>
            <li>Complete "Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in Java" lesson 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-gui-programming.mp4"
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Review the answers from Quiz 2</li>
            <li>Take one last look at "How to Be a Success Programmer" suggestions and intentionally decide if there is
            something you are going to change now that the programming assignments are becoming more challenging. 
                <a href="https://cpsc-24500.azurewebsites.net/successful-programmer.html" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>

                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~2 hours</li>
            <li>Complete your initial Discussion Board (DB) post by the middle of the sprint</li>
            <li>FaceDraw, FaceDraw, FaceDraw ~8 to 12 hours</li>
        </ol> 

        <p>Take a few minutes to reflect on how much you have learned by completing the FaceDraw project. It's likely a
        significant step up from anything you have programmed in the past. Well done.</p>

  <h3>Sprint 4: Interactive User Interfaces and Mosaic</h3>
        <br>

        <p><b><i>Welcome to sprint 4.</i></b> We have covered a lot of material in the first three sprints. I suspect
        that the FaceDraw programming assignment was challenging. As we near the halfway point of our course, we will
        continue to focus on delivering real software each sprint. This week we will continue with enhancing our
        programming skills by learning how to develop <b><i>interactive</i></b> applications while also learning how to
        read and write files.</p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">

    <h1>Coming Soon!!!</h1>
  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
  <h3>Sprint 5: Network Programming and The Cloud</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Wow! Sprint 5. How did that come so fast? I must say that I am impressed. This is a challenging class and
        it's obvious that you are working hard and delivering assignments that you are proud of delivering. Well done!
        </p>
        <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Develop your first network and distributed Java application</li>
            <li>Create a web service (website with JSON) utilizing the MS Azure cloud platform</li>
            <li>Develop intermediate command line Java applications that span multiple Java files</li>
            <li>Understand Software Testing and the basics of Software Development Life Cycles</li>
            <li>Describe multiple Object-Oriented Languages and Platforms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This sprint you will likely notice two changes. First, we will be taking a bit of a break from Java graphics
        programming and instead will focus our energy on Internet &amp; distributed programming and JSON. I think you
        will enjoy the change. But don't worry, we will get back to Java graphics programming soon enough. </P>
        <p>The second change you will see starting this sprint I will be looking for you to do more of your own research
        and decision making on assignments. For example, you will see topics this week relating to setting up Microsoft
        Azure static websites, accessing JSON files from Java, and developing more complex Java command line
        applications. In each of these cases I will be giving you some direction but will be looking for you to do the
        research and make your own choices on how you would like to implement solutions. </p>
        <p>Our activities list for this sprint include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review and start to work on Programming Assignment 5 and Quiz 5. </li>
            <li>Setup a Microsoft Azure account with a Microsoft Imagine educational subscription 
                    <a href="https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank">[link]</a>
                Or optionally, set up your account with a free trial subscription
                    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">[link]</a>. Although your free
                    trial will last 30 days, you will need to provide a credit card. You will also want to watch what
                    types of resources you access on your Azure account so that when you convert the account to
                    "pay-as-you-go", you will not experience any significant charges. For this class I will be guiding
                    you toward free or very low-cost cloud resources.</li>

  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
  <h3>Sprint 6: Multithreading and Application Programming Interfaces</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Sprint 6! This sprint offers a mix of the old and the new. Some things like hosting JSON files on our Azure
        websites and enhancing our SwissArmyKnife application will be additions to what we have already learned. On the
        other hand, learning how to write multi-threaded Java applications will likely prove to be challenging.</p>
            <p>By the end of this sprint we will be able to:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>Develop our first multi-threaded Java application</li>
                <li>Create / update a web service by hosting JSON files on MS Azure</li>
                <li>Enhance intermediate command line Java applications that span multiple Java files</li>
                <li>Create an automated (api level) Java test client
            </ul>
        <p>You will notice this sprint that it looks like our activities list is shrinking. Don't let that fool you. At
        this point in the class many of our activities are naturally migrating from our activities list to our
        assignments. This is because you are becoming more capable of researching and figuring out how to implement new
        features. </p>

        <p><em>Welcome to sprint 7.</em> How time flies. We have two separate programming assignment this sprint. The
        first assignment (PA7) is Thunderbird. We will be completing the Thunderbird application by the middle of the
        sprint. Thunderbird is also different than previous assignments in that we will be enhancing an existing
        application rather than creating a new application from scratch. This is more like what you could expect in an
        entry level professional programming position. I think you will enjoy it.</p>
        <p>The second half of the sprint will be entirely focused on completing version 1 of your final project.
